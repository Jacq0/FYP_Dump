# FYP_Dump
This is a dump containing many of the experimental scripts from my Final Year Project. These were never originally put on github as they were never in any functional/stable state and constantly changing in drastic ways.
Please note that many of these do not work as intended due to certain limitations in the hardware used for the project. I spent a lot of time trying to fix issues and work around limitations.
